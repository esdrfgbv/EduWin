  "title": "OS Level 5 — Process Synchronization & Critical Section",
  "intro": "This level focuses on the need for synchronization, critical section problem and classical solutions.",
  "points": [
    "Understand race conditions when multiple processes/threads access shared data.",
    "Define critical section, entry section, exit section and remainder section.",
    "State the three requirements for a correct solution: mutual exclusion, progress, bounded waiting.",
    "Know software solutions like Peterson’s algorithm (concept level).",
    "Understand the idea of hardware support: Test-and-Set, locks (at basic level)."
