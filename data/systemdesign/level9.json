      "question": "Metrics like p95 or p99 latency refer to:",
      "options": {
        "A": "Average response time",
        "B": "Latency experienced by the slowest request only",

      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Percentiles show tail latency, critical for user experience."

    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Blue-green deployment pattern means:",
      "options": {
        "A": "Deploy on one environment while the other stays idle, then switch traffic",
        "B": "Deploy directly to production with no testing",

        "D": "Deploy only at night"
      },
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Blue-green keeps a stable (blue) and new (green) environment to switch traffic safely."

      "id": 6,
      "question": "Canary release pattern is used to:",
      "options": {
        "A": "Roll out new versions to 100% of users immediately",
        "B": "Roll out to a small subset of traffic first to detect issues early",

      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Canarying mitigates risk by testing changes with a small population first."

    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "Circuit breaker pattern in microservices:",
      "options": {
        "A": "Increases traffic to slow services",
        "B": "Stops calls to a failing service temporarily to prevent cascading failures",
        "C": "Disables caching",
        "D": "Removes rate limiting"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Circuit breakers open when failure rates are high, short-circuiting requests."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "Retry logic should typically:",
      "options": {
        "A": "Retry infinitely with no delay",
        "B": "Use bounded retries with exponential backoff and jitter",
        "C": "Never use backoff",
        "D": "Be disabled always"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Backoff with jitter avoids synchronized retry storms and respects capacity."

      "question": "A runbook or playbook is:",
      "options": {
        "A": "A unit test report",
