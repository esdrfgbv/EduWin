      "question": "Which is TRUE about paging?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Pages are variable-sized blocks",
        "B": "It eliminates external fragmentation",
        "C": "It eliminates internal fragmentation",
        "D": "It does not use page tables"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Paging uses fixed-size frames/pages so external fragmentation is removed; internal fragmentation can remain."
