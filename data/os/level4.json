        "C": "File owner",
        "D": "CPU clock speed"

      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "File metadata includes name, size, type, owner, permissions, timestamps, etc., but not hardware properties."

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Inodes hold metadata and pointers to data blocks; names live in directories."

        "C": "Tree-structured directory",

      "question": "Contiguous allocation of file blocks suffers mainly from:",

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Contiguous allocation needs contiguous free space; growing a file may require relocation."

      "id": 5,
      "question": "Linked allocation of file blocks has which disadvantage?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Cannot support sequential access",
        "B": "Pointer overhead and poor random access",
        "C": "Requires external fragmentation",
        "D": "Needs fixed-size files"

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Following a linked list is fine for sequential access but slow for random indexing."

        "D": "Store only small files"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Index blocks store block pointers in one place, supporting random access without contiguous storage."

      "question": "Which of these file types is typically executable by the OS?",

        "C": "Symbolic link",
        "D": "Pipe"
      },
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Regular files can hold program binaries or scripts; directories and special files are not executed directly."

      "id": 8,
      "question": "Mounting a file system means:",
      "options": {
        "A": "Copying it to RAM",

      "options": {

        "C": "Checksum bits",
        "D": "File labels only"

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Classic UNIX permissions use rwx bits for owner, group and others."

      "options": {
        "A": "Avoiding any metadata writes",
