      "question": "Which statement about device independence is TRUE?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Applications must know exact device details",
        "B": "OS provides a common interface so apps need not care about device specifics",
        "C": "It applies only to network devices",
        "D": "It prevents new devices from being added"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Device independence lets the same I/O calls work for different devices."
