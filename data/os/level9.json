        "A": "Run only on a single machine",
        "B": "Make a collection of networked machines appear as a single coherent system",

        "D": "Only support real-time tasks"

      "explanation": "Distributed OS abstracts multiple nodes into a unified system view."

      "question": "In distributed systems, clock synchronization protocols (like NTP) are needed because:",
      "options": {
        "A": "All machines share the same hardware clock",
        "B": "Different machines have independent clocks that drift over time",
        "C": "Time does not matter",
        "D": "Only for power saving"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Each machine’s clock drifts; synchronization keeps them roughly aligned."

      "id": 3,
      "question": "Which of the following is TRUE about a hard real-time system?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Missing a deadline occasionally is acceptable",
        "B": "Missing a deadline is considered a system failure",
        "C": "No deadlines are specified",
        "D": "Only average response time matters"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Hard real-time requires strict deadline guarantees; misses are failures."

      "id": 4,
      "question": "A soft real-time system:",
      "options": {
        "A": "Does not use priorities",
        "B": "Allows occasional deadline misses but optimizes for low latency",

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Soft real-time treats deadlines as important but not absolutely strict."

      "options": {
        "A": "Shortest execution time",
        "B": "Longest period gets highest priority",
        "C": "Shortest period (highest frequency) gets highest priority",
        "D": "Random selection"

      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "In RMS, tasks with shorter periods run more frequently and get higher priority."

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Distributed systems must handle network partitions and partial failures where some nodes are unreachable."

        "D": "CPU utilization"

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Jitter is variability in timing; low jitter is desirable for predictable behavior."
