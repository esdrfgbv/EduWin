      "options": {
        "A": "Page is not in memory",
        "B": "Page is in memory but not in TLB",

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "On TLB miss, the OS/page-table lookup finds the page in memory and fills TLB."

        "D": "Virtual memory is disabled"

        "A": "Whether the page is dirty",
        "B": "Whether the page is present in physical memory",

        "D": "Whether the page is read-only"
