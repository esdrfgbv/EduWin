      "question": "Which of the following best describes the principle of least privilege?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Users should have access to all system resources",
        "B": "Users should have only the minimal privileges necessary to perform their tasks",
        "C": "Privileges never change",
        "D": "Only administrators can have privileges"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Least privilege reduces damage if an account is compromised or misused."

      "question": "Access Control List (ACL) for a file specifies:",
      "options": {
        "A": "Which users and groups have what permissions on that object",

        "C": "CPU scheduling priority",
        "D": "Network routes"

        "C": "What have you done?",
        "D": "Where are you?"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Authentication verifies identity; authorization decides permissions."

      "question": "Which is TRUE about user-mode vs kernel-mode separation?",
      "options": {
        "A": "User-mode code can execute all privileged instructions",
        "B": "Kernel-mode can access all hardware and memory; user-mode is restricted",
        "C": "Kernel-mode is slower than user-mode",
        "D": "There is no security benefit"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Mode separation protects the system by limiting what user applications can do directly."

        "D": "Only for containers"

        "D": "Forcing single-threaded programs"

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "NX/DEP marks memory regions as non-executable to prevent injected code from running."

      "id": 9,
      "question": "Mandatory Access Control (MAC) differs from Discretionary Access Control (DAC) mainly because:",
      "options": {
        "A": "In MAC, users can arbitrarily change object permissions",
        "B": "In MAC, policies are centrally defined and users cannot override them",
        "C": "MAC uses no policies",
        "D": "DAC is used only in networks"

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "MAC enforces system-wide policies (e.g., SELinux) independent of individual user choices."
