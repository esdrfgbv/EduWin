    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "Which SQL feature allows using the result of one query as input to another within the same statement?",
      "options": {
        "A": "JOIN",
        "B": "Subquery",
        "C": "VIEW",
        "D": "CURSOR"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Subqueries are nested SELECT statements whose results are used by outer queries."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "A correlated subquery is one that:",
      "options": {
        "A": "Does not reference any table from the outer query",
        "B": "Is executed only once",
        "C": "References columns from the outer query and is evaluated per-row",
        "D": "Only works in the FROM clause"
      },
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correlated subqueries depend on each row of the outer query, so they are re-evaluated for each row."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "Which SQL clause is used to create a named, stored query that can be treated like a virtual table?",
      "options": {
        "A": "CREATE TABLE",
        "B": "CREATE VIEW",
        "C": "CREATE INDEX",
        "D": "CREATE TRIGGER"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "CREATE VIEW defines a logical view over existing base tables."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "Which of the following is TRUE about views?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Views always store a separate copy of the data",
        "B": "Views are always updatable",
        "C": "Views can provide a security layer by exposing limited columns/rows",
        "D": "Views cannot use joins"
      },
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Views can hide underlying schema details and restrict access to specific data."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "A trigger in SQL is best described as:",
      "options": {
        "A": "A scheduled backup job",
        "B": "A stored procedure that runs automatically when certain events occur on a table",
        "C": "A constraint that checks values",
        "D": "A type of index"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Triggers automatically execute in response to INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE or other events."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "Which SQL operation returns all distinct rows from two queries (like union of sets)?",
      "options": {
        "A": "UNION",
        "B": "UNION ALL",
        "C": "INTERSECT",
        "D": "EXCEPT"
      },
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "UNION removes duplicates; UNION ALL keeps them."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "To find rows that appear in the first result but not in the second, which operator is used in standard SQL?",
      "options": {
        "A": "UNION",
        "B": "UNION ALL",
        "C": "INTERSECT",
        "D": "EXCEPT (or MINUS)"
      },
      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "EXCEPT (or MINUS in some DBMSs) subtracts one result set from another."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "Which of the following can make a view non-updatable?",
      "options": {
        "A": "The view is defined over a single base table with no joins",
        "B": "The view contains an aggregate function and GROUP BY",
        "C": "The view directly references a primary key column",
        "D": "The view has a WHERE clause"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Aggregations and GROUP BY often prevent mapping updates back to base rows, making views non-updatable."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "Which clause is used to give a temporary name to a result in the FROM clause (subquery factoring)?",
      "options": {
        "A": "ALIAS",
        "B": "AS",
        "C": "WITH",
        "D": "TEMP TABLE"
      },
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "WITH (common table expression) names a subquery that can be reused within the same statement."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "CHECK constraints in SQL are used to:",
      "options": {
        "A": "Ensure referential integrity between tables",
        "B": "Enforce a boolean condition on values in a column or row",
        "C": "Encrypt data in a column",
        "D": "Create an index automatically"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "CHECK constraints enforce arbitrary logical conditions (e.g., salary > 0)."
