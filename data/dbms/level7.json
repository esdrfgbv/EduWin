      "id": 2,
      "question": "Which of the following statements about clustered indexes is TRUE?",
      "options": {
        "A": "They store index entries in random order",
        "B": "They determine the physical order of rows in the table",
        "C": "They cannot be used with primary keys",
        "D": "They are always hash-based"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Clustered indexes define the physical ordering of table records."

      "question": "Hash indexes are generally NOT suitable for:",
      "options": {
        "A": "Equality searches (WHERE id = 10)",
        "B": "Range queries (WHERE id BETWEEN 5 AND 20)",
        "C": "Point lookups by primary key",
        "D": "Probing by exact key"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Hash indexes do not preserve ordering, so range scans are inefficient."

      "question": "In a B+ tree of order m, each internal node (except possibly root) has:",
      "options": {
        "A": "At most m children and at least 2 children",

      "question": "Which component of a DBMS is mainly responsible for choosing an efficient query execution plan?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Query optimizer",
        "B": "Buffer manager",
        "C": "Transaction manager",

      "options": {
        "A": "Exists on all columns in the database",
        "B": "Includes all columns referenced in the query, so table lookup is not needed",
        "C": "Covers multiple tables at once",
        "D": "Always uses hash functions"

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "If all needed columns are in the index, the DBMS can avoid accessing the base table."

      "question": "Selectivity of an index refers to:",
      "options": {
        "A": "The number of columns indexed",

        "C": "The cost of creating an index",
        "D": "The ordering of index keys"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "High selectivity = predicate matches a small fraction, making the index more useful."

        "A": "Nested-loop join (simple)",
        "B": "Index nested-loop join",
        "C": "Sort-merge join or hash join",
        "D": "Cross join without condition"

      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Sort-merge or hash joins handle large inputs efficiently for equi-joins."

        "C": "Optimizing queries",
        "D": "Managing user authentication"

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The buffer manager decides which disk pages to keep in memory and which to evict."

      "id": 10,
      "question": "Which of the following is TRUE about cost-based query optimization?",
      "options": {
        "A": "It ignores indexes and always scans tables fully",
        "B": "It uses statistics (like histograms) to estimate cost of different plans",
        "C": "It simply chooses the lexicographically smallest plan",
        "D": "It only works for SELECT queries without joins"

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Cost-based optimizers rely on statistics about data distribution and table sizes."
