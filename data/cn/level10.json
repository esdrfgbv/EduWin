    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "Which high-level architecture best represents a secure web application deployment?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Internet → database server (public IP) → web server (private IP)",
        "B": "Internet → load balancer in public subnet → web/app servers in private subnet → database in deeper private subnet",
        "C": "Internet → single server with web app and database exposed on all ports",
        "D": "Internet → firewall → all servers on the same flat network"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Placing public-facing components in a public subnet and sensitive components in private subnets is a common secure design."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "How do HTTPS and firewall rules together help secure a web application?",
      "options": {
        "A": "HTTPS provides encryption; firewall restricts which ports and sources can reach internal components",
        "B": "HTTPS replaces the need for any firewalls",
        "C": "Firewalls provide encryption and HTTPS provides routing",
        "D": "They only protect against hardware failures"
      },
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "HTTPS encrypts data in transit; firewalls enforce which traffic is allowed between the Internet and internal servers."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "In network security, a DMZ (demilitarized zone) is:",
      "options": {
        "A": "A fully trusted internal network for databases",
        "B": "A network segment that hosts public-facing services, separated from both Internet and internal LAN",
        "C": "A feature of TCP congestion control",
        "D": "Another term for VPN tunnel"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A DMZ isolates public-facing servers (like reverse proxy/load balancer) from the core internal network."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "Which of the following is the BEST set of logs/metrics to monitor for security and performance in a web app environment?",
      "options": {
        "A": "CPU temperature only",
        "B": "Web server access/error logs, firewall logs, and metrics like latency/error rates",
        "C": "Only database size growth",
        "D": "Only number of open browser tabs on clients"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Combining application, network, and system metrics/logs helps detect attacks and performance issues."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Which option best illustrates applying the principle of least privilege in a secure web app network?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Allow all ports between web servers and database servers",
        "B": "Give the database user full admin rights on the OS",
        "C": "Allow only specific ports between app and DB, and give the DB user only required permissions",
        "D": "Use the same admin account for all services"
      },
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Least privilege means allowing only the minimal access needed—both in firewall rules and in account permissions."
