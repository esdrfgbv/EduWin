    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "For an office with 30 computers that needs Internet access, which of the following is the most appropriate basic topology?",
      "options": {
        "A": "All PCs connected in a ring directly with coaxial cable",
        "B": "ISP modem/router → switch(es) → PCs and Wi-Fi access point(s)",
        "C": "Each PC directly connected to the ISP modem via its own cable",
        "D": "Only a single Wi-Fi router with no switches and all PCs on Wi-Fi"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A typical small office design uses an ISP router, one or more switches, and APs for wireless devices."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "Which IPv4 addressing plan is most suitable for a single small office subnet with up to 30 devices?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Use public block 8.8.8.0/24 on all devices directly",
        "B": "Use private subnet 192.168.1.0/24 with DHCP from the router",
        "C": "Use 127.0.0.0/8 for all hosts",
        "D": "Use 169.254.0.0/16 for planned static addresses"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A private /24 like 192.168.1.0/24 with the router acting as DHCP server is standard for small offices."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "In a typical office, which devices are best connected via wired Ethernet instead of Wi-Fi?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Desktops and servers that require stable, high-throughput connections",
        "B": "Smartphones only",
        "C": "Visitors’ laptops only",
        "D": "All devices must be wireless by design"
      },
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Wired Ethernet offers higher reliability and stable bandwidth, ideal for desktops and servers."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "How can VLANs help when an office has Admin and Dev departments sharing the same physical switches?",
      "options": {
        "A": "VLANs increase Internet speed automatically",
        "B": "VLANs logically separate traffic so Admin and Dev can be isolated while sharing hardware",
        "C": "VLANs remove the need for IP addressing",
        "D": "VLANs replace the need for routers entirely"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "VLANs logically segment networks on the same switches, improving isolation and security."

      "id": 5,
      "question": "Which option is a common way to add WAN redundancy for high-availability Internet in a small office?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Use two different ISPs connected to a dual-WAN router with automatic failover",
        "B": "Use only Wi-Fi instead of wired connections",
        "C": "Increase the number of switches on the LAN",
        "D": "Disable DHCP on the router"
      },
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "A dual-WAN router with two ISPs allows failover if one link goes down."
