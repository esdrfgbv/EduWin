    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "Which of the following is a key characteristic of TCP?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Connectionless and unreliable",
        "B": "Connection-oriented and reliable",
        "C": "Used only for streaming video",
        "D": "Does not support port numbers"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "TCP provides reliable, connection-oriented, byte-stream transport with sequencing and retransmission."

      "id": 2,
      "question": "UDP is preferred over TCP when:",
      "options": {
        "A": "Reliability is more important than delay",
        "B": "Applications can tolerate some loss but need low latency (e.g., live streaming)",
        "C": "We need guaranteed in-order delivery",
        "D": "We are transferring critical banking data"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "UDP is connectionless and low-latency, suitable for real-time apps that tolerate some packet loss."

      "id": 3,
      "question": "Which protocol commonly uses TCP port 80?",
      "options": {
        "A": "FTP",
        "B": "SMTP",
        "C": "HTTP",
        "D": "DNS (query)"
      },
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Port 80/TCP is the default port for HTTP web traffic."

      "id": 4,
      "question": "Which feature is NOT provided by UDP but is provided by TCP?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Congestion control",
        "B": "Checksum for error detection",
        "C": "Multiplexing via ports",
        "D": "Support for IPv4 and IPv6"
      },
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "TCP implements congestion control; UDP is much simpler and does not."

      "id": 5,
      "question": "TCP connection establishment typically uses:",
      "options": {
        "A": "Two-way handshake",
        "B": "Three-way handshake",
        "C": "Four-way handshake",
        "D": "No handshake is required"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "TCP uses SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK (three-way handshake) to establish a connection."
