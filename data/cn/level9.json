    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "Users report that a web application is very slow. Which initial step best helps distinguish between a local network issue and a remote/server issue?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Immediately reinstall the browser on all client PCs",
        "B": "Ping the default gateway and then an external IP like 8.8.8.8",
        "C": "Upgrade all switches to 10 Gbps",
        "D": "Change the office Wi-Fi password"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Pinging the gateway checks local network; pinging an external IP checks connectivity beyond the LAN."
    },

      "id": 2,
      "question": "Frequent disconnections in a video call app are MOST likely caused by:",
      "options": {
        "A": "A faulty keyboard",
        "B": "Wi-Fi interference or network congestion leading to packet loss",
        "C": "A wrong system time on PCs",
        "D": "Using HTTPS instead of HTTP"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Real-time apps are sensitive to packet loss and jitter, often caused by wireless issues or congestion."
    },

      "id": 3,
      "question": "Only one user in the office has slow Internet while others are fine. Which check should be done FIRST?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Replace all switches in the office",
        "B": "Check that user’s network adapter status, cable/Wi-Fi signal and background downloads",
        "C": "Change the ISP for the whole office",
        "D": "Reconfigure the core router’s WAN IP"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Since the problem is isolated to one user, start with that host’s local connection and processes."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "Users experience brief disconnections every hour. Which of the following is MOST likely a layer 1 or 2 cause?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Incorrect DNS record for external website",
        "B": "Loose Ethernet cable or failing switch port",
        "C": "Invalid SSL certificate on the server",
        "D": "Wrong subnet mask on the WAN link"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Physical or data-link issues like loose cables and bad ports can cause intermittent link drops."

    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Why is having a performance baseline for the network useful?",
      "options": {
        "A": "It eliminates the need for monitoring tools",
        "B": "It allows you to compare current metrics with normal values to detect anomalies",
        "C": "It guarantees that no future problems will occur",
        "D": "It is only required for wireless networks"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A baseline helps identify abnormal latency, throughput, or loss by comparison with known-good conditions."
